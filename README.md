The above figure shows the outcome trendlines for funding projects based on the month funding began. Based on the above data, the optimal times to begin a kickstarter campaign is May, with February being the second. These two months have the high success rates, and the largest difference between successful, and failed kickstarters.

Theater projects in the US are corwdfunded frequently on kickstarter. They have the highest number of projects both sucessful and failed. Based on this, some advertising/ensentive is recomended to ensure your project gets viewed and traction on kickstarter.

Expanding on the previous chart, and diving into the Theater subcategory, we see that plays are the most popular, and most successfully funded.

Looking to the descriptive statistics. The successful kickstarters for plays have a mean goal of $5,049 and receive much higher value donations than the failed kickstarters. However, the standard deviations (std) are all roughly twice the interquarterly range (IQR) in each distribution, meaning the aveage goal and pledge are being skewed by some very large goals and pledges. This is exagerated further in the failed kickstarters where the std is three times the IQR.


To conclude, it is recomended a goal of roughly $5000, and to begin funding in May for your theatrical play 'fever'. There are limitations within this anylsis, specifially the lack of specific data on theatrical plays, with roughly 675 data points.
